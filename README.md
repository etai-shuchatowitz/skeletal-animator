# skeletal-animator
This is a simple skeletal-animator.
 
Upon running, it will render a scene with a house object and 
upon user input will add various skeletal characters to the scene. 

Any Collada file (.dae) can be rendered with its associated animations.

Similarly, it can support any .obj file and .md5mesh. As it was built using assimp, I suspect it can handle
other file types though these are the only ones it has been tested on.

## How to Build

```shell
git clone 
mvn clean package

```
